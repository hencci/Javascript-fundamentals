// Variables are the building blocks of any program, you can think of variables as “storage containers” for data in your code.

// You can declare variables using the let keyword
let firstname = "John";
let surname = "Doe";

console.log(firstname);
console.log(surname);

// You can also re-assign variables
let age = 11;
console.log(age); // outputs 11 to the console

age = 54;
 
console.log(age); // what will be output now?


// Re-assigning is cool and all, but what if we don’t want it to happen? We can accomplish this using the 'const' keyword.
const pi = 3.14;

// Add 2 numbers together!
console.log(23 + 97);

// Add a sequence of 6 different numbers together.
console.log(5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5);
