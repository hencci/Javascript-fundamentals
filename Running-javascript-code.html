    <!-- The simplest way to get started is to create an HTML file with the JavaScript code inside of it. -->

    <script>
        // Your JavaScript goes here!
        console.log("Hello, World!")
    </script>

    <!-- console.log() is the command to print something to the developer console in your browser. -->


    <!-- Another way to include JavaScript in a webpage is through an external script. This is very similar to linking external CSS docs to your website. -->
    <script src="javascript.js"></script>
